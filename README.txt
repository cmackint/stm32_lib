This is a small collection of simple embedded programs for an STM32 M-series chip.

I wanted to learn more about what the STM-provided hardware abstraction layer (HAL) did.

As a result, I created several example projects using the STM-provided HAL. I then
re-created them using my own custom stripped-down HAL, custom linker, and custom startup ARM assembly
